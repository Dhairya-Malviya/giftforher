  <h1>To the one who gives my life meaning</h1>
  <p>Dear Anushka....,</p>
  <p class="body">Just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me even i dont talk about this to you much...</p>
  <p class="body">When I look at you, I see the most beautiful creation of God—your eyes. I could stare into them all day without ever getting bored, from sunrise to sunset, from moonrise to moonset.
You came into my life when I was at my lowest, and I never thought someone like you could have a crush on me. Funny thing is, I had a crush on you too, but I didn’t think I was good enough (still don’t, to be honest :3).
You’re the reason I want to improve myself. You give my life meaning and purpose. I love everything about you, and I cherish the love you give me.
You're the rare beauty that no algorithm could ever replicate.
I love you soooo much!! &lt;&lt;33
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Today 12th of April marks your 15th Birthday!It’s not just your birthday—it’s the celebration of the day the world got a little brighter.
Fifteen years of your beautiful existence, and I feel lucky to be part of your story.
You’ve grown into someone so amazing, and I can’t wait to see the person you’ll become.
I hope this year brings you more smiles, more laughter, and everything your heart desires.
Thank you for being born, and thank you for being you. Happy Birthday, my sunshine!
  </p>
  <P class="body">
    I cant wait to see what the future holds for us and what we'll experience together!
  </P>
  <p>Forever yours,</p>
